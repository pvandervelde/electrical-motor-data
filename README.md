# electrical-motor-data

This repository contains a collection of data describing different electrical motors. The `motors` directory
contains a directory for each motor. This directory contains a `yaml` file with data describing the motor
and further sub-directories containing test data for the motor if available.

This repository also contains a number of python scripts that can be used to create the motor curves
for the motors and determine the gear ratio in order for a given motor to achieve a certain torque
at a certain speed.
